<div class="headerTitle">Save the Bees</div>
<div class="Intro">You may not realise it, but by cutting the grass in our gardens and on our greens we reduce the number of wild flowers and plants which bees need to collect pollen in order to survive, make honey and to pollinate other plants.
</div>
<div class="section">Although bees and other insects can be seen as pests the reality is that the loss of our bees will mean a reduction in the quality and quantity of our locally produced fruit and veg. This will also lead to the price of these goods rising.
